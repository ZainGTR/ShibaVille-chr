# Multiplayer Tower Defense Game on Chromia

## Overview

This project is a multiplayer tower defense game inspired by Clash of Clans but with unique gameplay mechanics.
Players can create and manage countries, towns, and buildings, produce troops and resources, and engage in battles to colonize other towns.
The game leverages Chromia's Rell language to build a decentralized application with robust game mechanics.

## Features

1. **Country Management**

   - Anyone can create a country.
   - Each country has a 10% tax on all towns' resources.
   - Countries have 1000 bonds that can be bought by anyone.
   - Towns holding bonds receive rewards from 10% of the collected taxes.
   - The remaining 90% of taxes are held in the country's vault.
   - The vault can be accessed by towns through voting to fund wars with other countries.

2. **Town Management**

   - Players can create towns within countries.
   - Towns can allocate lands for buildings.
   - Towns can hold bonds and participate in voting for using the country's vault funds.

3. **Building System**

   - Players can construct buildings on allocated lands.
   - Buildings can produce troops or resources.
   - Buildings can be upgraded to higher levels.

4. **Colonization Mechanics**
   - Players can attack other towns.
   - Surviving troops from successful attacks can colonize the attacked town.
   - Colonized towns pay 50% taxes to the invader until they are freed.
